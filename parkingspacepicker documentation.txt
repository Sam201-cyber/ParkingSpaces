img = cv2.imread('carParkImg.png')
 is used to load the picture i.e our jpg image of parking lot.

width , height = 105, 48
it basically decide  how big each parking spot box should be 


def mouseClick(events, x, y, flags, params):
 this is the mouse click function , if u click right it will add a parking spot of the size u set to it and on right click to it  , it will drop that spot.

and to not loose previous spots that we spoted we used here  try and except ; 

try:
    with open('CarParkPos', 'rb') as f:
        posList = pickle.load(f)
except:
    posList = []





the while:True is used to show the image again and again showing the images and boxes. 


and to show he parking boxes :

 for pos in posList:
    cv2.rectangle(img, pos,(pos[0]+width,pos[1]+height), (255, 0, 255), 2)


cv2.imshow("Image",img)
 to show the image

cv2.setMouseCallback("Image",mouseClick)
this is here to tell the program to run the mouse click fn when u click 


and at the end    cv2.wait(1)
TO GIVE A TINY PAUSE SO UR COMPUTER  CAN KEEP UPDATING IMAGES
